# LaunchpadApp
A fully ready-to-build package hosted on a "private" GitHub repository

Instructions are on the top left of the screen, didn't have time to make a menu or a pause function at the start so you might reset a few times before you get used to the controls. I recommend immediately pressing tab on entering the game and each time it resets (sorry bout that) to enable inverse controls.

If I were to continue the project, this would be the immediate todo list:
1. Fix dragon getting stuck between buildings
2. Create a pause menu
3. Minimap icons
4. Create a main menu
5. Create tutorial
6. Snazz up the UI with actual art
